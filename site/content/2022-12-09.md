### [PSF Introduces Sliding Scale Membership starting at $25](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/12/introducing-new-sliding-scale-membership.html?m=1)

submitted by [kjaymiller](https://github.com/kjaymiller) on 2022-12-09T05:27:20Z

The PSF has created a [sliding scale](https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=39) to become a PSF Supporting Member.
This tier is design to make PSF Membership more accessible to more individuals world-wide.
> We welcome you to sign up for a sliding scale Supporting Membership if the [standard Supporting Membership rate](https://psfmember.org/python-software-foundation-supporting-member-2/) presents a financial burden to you.
The PSF states this is a great option for unemployed/underemployed, students, or those working in a country with lower average incomes than that of the US/Western Europe. While these are examples you will not be asked to justify your selection.
Funding goes to supporting Python Communities and Infrastructure.


### [ChatGPT temporarily banned for StackOverflow answers](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned)

submitted by [kjaymiller](https://github.com/kjaymiller) on 2022-12-09T05:06:13Z

Tech answer site Stack Overflow has issued a temporary ban on answered generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT.
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) which interacts in a conversational way is like how [one Twitter user](https://twitter.com/jimhester_/status/1599877181634940928) put it "just like my 7 year old nephew, who will confidently tell you the answer to any question you ask even if he has no idea what he is talking about."
This creates the problem of the most confident yet incorrect answers contributed to the site by the thousands. This potentially erodes the trust in answers on the site.
Per the [Help Center](https://stackoverflow.com/help/gpt-policy) - "Moderators are empowered (at their discretion) to issue immediate suspensions of up to 30 days to users who are copying and pasting GPT content onto the site, with or without prior notice or warning."

### [Security Patches and Updates to Python 3.11, 3.10, 3.9, 3.8, and 3.7](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2022/12/python-3111-3109-3916-3816-3716-and.html)

submitted by [kjaymiller](https://github.com/kjaymiller) on 2022-12-07T06:29:47Z

This update is for 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, 3.7.16 and the latest 3.12 alpha (3).
Another all supported versions update usually means security patches and this one is no different. There are 4 security updates for all of the updated versions and 3 bonus security fixes for the older versions (3.7-3.10).
3.11.1 also features more commits than 3.10.1 did from it's [dot-zero] release.
> A whopping 495 new commits since 3.11.0. This is a massive increase of changes comparing to 3.10 at the same stage in the release cycle: there were “only” 339 commits between 3.10.0 and 3.10.1.
Python 3.11 was release at the end of October and was praised for its massive performance updates and updates to error handling among many other features.
