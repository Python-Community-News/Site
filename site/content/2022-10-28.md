### [Thousands of GitHub repositories deliver fake PoC exploits with malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-github-repositories-deliver-fake-poc-exploits-with-malware/)

submitted by [kjaymiller](https://github.com/kjaymiller] on 2022-10-27T03:39:41Z)

Researchers at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science found thousands of repositories on GitHub that offer fake proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for various vulnerabilities, some of them including malware.
According to the [technical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08374#) from the researchers at Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, the possibility of getting infected with malware instead of obtaining a PoC could be as high as 10.3%, excluding proven fakes and prankware.
Soufian believes that all testers should follow these three steps:
- Read carefully the code you are about to run on your or your customer's network.
- If the code is too obfuscated and needs too much time to analyze manually, sandbox it in an environment (ex: an isolated Virtual Machine) and check your network for any suspicious traffic.
- Use open-source intelligence tools like VirusTotal to analyze binaries.
The researchers have reported all the malicious repositories they discovered to GitHub, but it will take some time until all of them are reviewed and removed, so many still remain available to the public.
