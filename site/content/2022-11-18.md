The Django Software foundation announced the list of candidates for their board. This year has 31 candidates representing 18 countries with every continent (excluding Antartica) with at least one person representing.
The DSF is responsible for supporting development of Django web framework and its community by sponsoring sprints, meetups, gatherings and community events.
Earlier this year we saw the largest candidacy pool for the larger Python Software foundation continuing a trend of increased desire to represent the language and community at the highest levels. That said voter turnout is still very low with less than 1% of people that use the language participating in its board elections.
The DSF Elections are a closed election only available for DSF members. If you feel like you should be a member you can request to become one on the [Django Website](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/).
